Sublime Text 2 provides a free and pretty good dev environment. http://www.sublimetext.com/2

Once you got it, install the powerful package manager:

http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/installation

That will help you install the code intel tools.

Then you'll want to install TernJS that provide an autocompletion server: http://emmet.io/blog/sublime-tern/

Create a sublime text project at the root of you cloud code folder, alongside ./cloud and ./config Edit you PROJECT_NAME.sublime-project with your favorite editor:

{
    "folders":
    [
        {

            "path": "cloud"
        }
    ],
    "ternjs": {
        "include": ["*.js"],
        "loadEagerly": [
            "PATH_TO_PARSEJS/Parse.js"
        ],
            "plugins": {
            }
        }
}
Download the Parse.js SDK from Parse and put it at PATH_TO_PARSEJS/Parse.js

Sublime will now be able to autocomplete with Parse SDK as well as all *.js file in the scope of the project.

Happy Coding!
